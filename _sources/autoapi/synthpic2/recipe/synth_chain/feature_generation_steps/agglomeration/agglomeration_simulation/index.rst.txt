.. py:function:: agglomeration(primary_particles: list[synthpic2.recipe.synth_chain.feature_generation_steps.agglomeration.agglomerate.Agglomerate], mode: str, randomness: float, translation_speed: float, sintering_ratio: float = 0, rotation_speed: float = 0) -> synthpic2.recipe.synth_chain.feature_generation_steps.agglomeration.agglomerate.Agglomerate

   Simulate agglomeration of particles.

   Args:
       primary_particles (list[Agglomerate]): List of primary particles (agglomerates
           without children).
       mode (str): Agglomeration mode
           "cluster-cluster" or
           "particle-cluster"
       translation_speed (float): Relative translation step size, between two
           collision checks.
       randomness (float): Number between 0 and 1, to control the randomness of the
           random walk:
               0 = straight translation, constant rotation
               1 = completely random walk, stochastic rotation
       sintering_ratio (float, optional): Number between 0 and 1, to control how
           close the centers of mass of the two touching primary particles will be
           after the collision:
               0 = particles will just barely touch after the collision
               1 = centers of mass will be identical
           Defaults to 0.
       rotation_speed (float, optional): Sum of the rotation intervals in x-, y-
           and z-direction between two collision checks, for both collision
           partners, as fraction of 360 degrees.
           Defaults to 0.

   Raises:
       ValueError: if an unknown agglomeration mode is specified

   Returns:
       Agglomerate: agglomerated primary particles

   Simulate particle-cluster agglomeration of particles (i.e. one by one).

   Args:
       primary_particles (list[Agglomerate]): List of primary particles (agglomerates
           without children).

           and z-direction between two collision checks, for both collision

   Returns:
       Agglomerate: agglomerated primary particles

   Simulate cluster-cluster agglomeration of particles (i.e. in form of a binary
       tree).

   Args:
       primary_particles (list[Agglomerate]): List of primary particles (agglomerates
           without children).
       translation_speed (float): Relative translation step size, between two
