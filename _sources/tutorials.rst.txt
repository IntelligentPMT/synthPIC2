Tutorials
=========

Here we describe some tutorials of using synthPIC2.

Basic Start
-----------

In this basic tutorials, we will learn how to generally approach the synthesis of an ensemble of particles in a measurement volume. We learn to import particle geometries and change various features based on previously defined criteria.

Advanced Topics
---------------

The tutorials in these sections will cover more advanced methods to generate more realistically looking scenes. The varied features and new render modes are intended for a rather productive use of ``synthPIC2``.
